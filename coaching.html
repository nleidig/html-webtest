    <p>Hello everyone,

        My passion involves mentoring & coaching people from all backgrounds & cultures, specialising in working with Australia’s First Nations peoples.
        
        Catching up with my family and friends to play sport together is one of my favourite things to do.
        
        I have coached/mentored youth in Adelaide and interstate for 20 years.
        
        Traveling around Australia mentoring/coaching has been important for me to grow and mature as a person.
        
        Coaching junior sports teams to represent Australia overseas in Hong Kong, Somoa and Fiji have been wonderful experiences.
        
        I enjoy making honest connections based on respectful communication and trust. These healthy connections I have made with youth/athletes and their families are very special and will always be treasured.
        
        Great role models have played an important part in my life growing up which had a very positive impact on guiding and supporting me through the tough challenges I have faced. These important figures in my life have played key roles in supporting me to get to where I am today. These role models still guide me this day which drive me forward to my future dreams.
        
        For these role models in my life I am thankful that their finger prints of great character will be on my life forever.
        
        My goal is to continue their work by impacting other young lives so they too can live their very best life in optimism & gladness know they’re being supported in heading in a positive direction.
        
        We all need someone of great character in our corner who has our back through the thick and thin.
        
        This is my mission and destiny.
        
        Looking forward to hearing from you.
        
        Please feel free to contact me if you have any questions.
        
        Thanks,
        
        Anzac Leidig.</p>
